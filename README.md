## General Information
- Repo contains multiple regression notebook for AI ML course Bike sharing assignment.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Completed EDA, feature selection and model building. Finally build a MLR model with train r2 accuracy score of 82% and test r2 score of 79%
